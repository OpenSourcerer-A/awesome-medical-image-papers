| 2018 | X-ray Computed Tomography Through Scatter | Adam Geva, Yoav Y. Schechner, Yonatan Chernyak, Rajiv Gupta | In current Xray CT scanners, tomographic reconstruction relies only on directly transmitted photons. The models used for reconstruction have regarded photons scattered by the body as noise or disturbance to be disposed of, either by acquisition hardware (an anti-scatter grid) or by the reconstruction software. This increases the radiation dose delivered to the patient. Treating these scattered photons as a source of information, we solve an inverse problem based on a 3D radiative transfer model that includes both elastic (Rayleigh) and inelastic (Compton) scattering. We further present ways to make the solution numerically efficient. The resulting tomographic reconstruction is more accurate than traditional CT, while enabling significant dose reduction and chemical decomposition. Demonstrations include both simulations based on a standard medical phantom and a real scattering tomography experiment. | 在当前的X射线CT扫描仪中，层析重建仅依赖于直接透射的光子。用于重建的模型将身体散射的光子视为噪声或干扰，需要通过采集硬件（抗散射网）或重建软件来处理。这增加了患者接受的辐射剂量。将这些散射光子视为信息源，我们基于包括弹性（瑞利）和非弹性（康普顿）散射的3D辐射传输模型解决了一个逆问题。我们进一步提出了使解决方案在数值上更有效的方法。由此产生的层析重建比传统CT更准确，同时实现了辐射剂量的显著减少和化学分解。演示包括基于标准医学幻影和真实散射层析实验的模拟。 | [link](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/papers/Adam_Geva_X-ray_Computational_Tomography_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf) |
| 2018 | K-convexity shape priors for segmentation | Hossam Isack, Lena Gorelick, Karin Ng, Olga Veksler, Yuri Boykov | This work extends popular star-convexity and other more general forms of convexity priors. We represent an object as a union of "convex'' overlappable subsets. Since an arbitrary shape can always be divided into convex parts, our regularization model restricts the number of such parts. Previous k-part shape priors are limited to disjoint parts. For example, one approach segments an object via optimizing its $k$-coverage by disjoint convex parts, which we show is highly sensitive to local minima. In contrast, our shape model allows the convex parts to overlap, which both relaxes and simplifies the coverage problem, e.g. fewer parts are needed to represent any object. As shown in the paper, for many forms of convexity our regularization model is significantly more descriptive for any given k. Our shape prior is useful in practice, e.g. in biomedical applications, and its optimization is robust to local minima. | 这项工作扩展了流行的星凸性和其他更一般形式的凸性先验。我们将对象表示为“凸”可重叠的子集的并集。由于任意形状总是可以分成凸部分，我们的正则化模型限制了这些部分的数量。先前的k部分形状先验仅限于不相交的部分。例如，一种方法通过优化其由不相交凸部分的k覆盖来分割对象，我们表明这对局部最小值非常敏感。相比之下，我们的形状模型允许凸部分重叠，这既放松又简化了覆盖问题，例如需要更少的部分来表示任何对象。正如本文所示，对于许多形式的凸性，我们的正则化模型在任何给定的k下更具描述性。我们的形状先验在实践中非常有用，例如在生物医学应用中，其优化对局部最小值是鲁棒的。 | [link](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/papers/Hossam_Isack_K-convexity_shape_priors_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf) |
| 2018 | Multimodal image alignment through a multiscale chain of neural networks with application to remote sensing | Armand Zampieri, Guillaume Charpiat, Nicolas Girard, Yuliya Tarabalka | We tackle here the problem of multimodal image non-rigid registration, which is of prime importance in remote sensing and medical imaging. The difficulties encountered by classical registration approaches include feature design and slow optimization by gradient descent. By analyzing these methods, we note the significance of the notion of scale. We design easy-to-train, fully-convolutional neural networks able to learn scale-specific features. Once chained appropriately, they perform global registration in linear time, getting rid of gradient descent schemes by predicting directly the deformation. We show their performance in terms of quality and speed through various tasks of remote sensing multimodal image alignment. In particular, we are able to register correctly cadastral maps of buildings as well as road polylines onto RGB images, and outperform current keypoint matching methods. | 本文解决了多模态图像非刚性配准的问题，这在遥感和医学成像中至关重要。传统配准方法遇到的困难包括特征设计和通过梯度下降进行缓慢优化。通过分析这些方法，我们注意到尺度概念的重要性。我们设计了易于训练的全卷积神经网络，能够学习特定尺度的特征。一旦适当连接，它们可以在线性时间内执行全局配准，通过直接预测变形来消除梯度下降方案。我们通过各种遥感多模态图像对齐任务展示了它们在质量和速度方面的表现。特别地，我们能够正确地将建筑物的地籍图和道路折线注册到RGB图像上，并且胜过当前的关键点匹配方法。 | [link](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/papers/Armand_Zampieri_Multimodal_image_alignment_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf) |
| 2018 | Out-of-Distribution Detection Using an Ensemble of Self Supervised Leave-out Classifiers | Apoorv Vyas, Nataraj Jammalamadaka, Xia Zhu, Dipankar Das, Bharat Kaul, Theodore L. Willke | As deep learning methods form a critical part in commercially important applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics, it is important to reliably detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs while employing these algorithms. In this work, we propose an OOD detection algorithm which comprises of an ensemble of classifiers. We train each classifier in a self-supervised manner by leaving out a random subset of training data as OOD data and the rest as in-distribution (ID) data. We propose a novel margin-based loss over the softmax output which seeks to maintain at least a margin m between the average entropy of the OOD and in-distribution samples. In conjunction with the standard cross-entropy loss, we minimize the novel loss to train an ensemble of classifiers. We also propose a novel method to combine the outputs of the ensemble of classifiers to obtain OOD detection score and class prediction. Overall, our method convincingly outperforms Hendrycks et al. [7] and the current state-of-the-art ODIN [13] on several OOD detection benchmarks. | 随着深度学习方法在自动驾驶和医学诊断等商业重要应用中发挥关键作用，使用这些算法时可靠地检测出分布外（OOD）输入至关重要。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种由多个分类器组成的OOD检测算法。我们通过将随机子集的训练数据作为OOD数据，其余作为分布内（ID）数据，以自监督方式训练每个分类器。我们提出了一种基于softmax输出的新型边缘损失，旨在保持OOD和分布内样本的平均熵之间至少有一个边缘m。结合标准的交叉熵损失，我们最小化这种新型损失来训练一组分类器。我们还提出了一种新方法来结合分类器集合的输出，以获得OOD检测分数和类别预测。总体而言，我们的方法在几个OOD检测基准上明显优于Hendrycks等人和当前最先进的ODIN。 | [link](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/papers/Apoorv_Vyas_Out-of-Distribution_Detection_Using_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf) |
